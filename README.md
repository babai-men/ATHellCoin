📘 README: Tokenomics Overview
💡 Concept
This project is built on principles of deflation, engagement, and fair distribution. The goal is to create a sustainable ecosystem where token value grows through limited supply and active community participation.

🔥 Tokenomics Highlights
1. Annual Token Burn
Amount: 1% of total supply.

Sources:

Liquidity pools — treated as "coal for burning," fueling the ecosystem.

Team allocation — burned as a form of "discipline," reinforcing long-term commitment.

Purpose: Create scarcity and stimulate token value appreciation.

2. Quarterly Airdrops
Requirement: Holding Solana (SOL) in wallet.

Mechanism: Automatic token distribution to SOL holders.

Purpose: Encourage loyalty and expand the community.

📊 Token Distribution
Category	Share (%)
Liquidity	55%
Airdrop	30%
Development	5%
Team	5%
Solana Ecosystem	5%

🧩 Summary
This tokenomics model creates a self-sustaining loop where each element reinforces the next. It enables organic growth, preserves token value, and incentivizes long-term participation.
